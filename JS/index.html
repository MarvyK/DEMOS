        Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed to
        making science accessible to all.

        Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early
        understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything
        from
      </p>
      <p>
        galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself. The aim of
        our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the
        wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to
        continue the exploration of the world around us. We believe science
        should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through
        exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many
        varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are
        designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to
        life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night
        when everyone’s gone home).
