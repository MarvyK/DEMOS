<p>Full time students - 1 week | Part time students ‚Äì 2 weeks</p>
<h4 style="border-bottom: 2px solid #b22a2c; padding-bottom: 0.5em"><strong>Brief</strong></h4>
<p>
  Using GitHub Projects, create a Kanban and Gantt style chart to serve as a living project plan that you can use to track and communicate your progress. Although you do not have the exam brief, your
  plan should still provide a useful structure by specifying each step in the process. <br />
  Use the Progression Plan spreadsheet to assist with selecting dates for each phase or task.
</p>

<h4 style="border-bottom: 2px solid #b22a2c; padding-bottom: 0.5em"><strong>Take note of the following</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    There should be a minimum of 15 discrete tasks in your plan. If you have fewer than this your task definitions may be too broad and should be made more specific. For example, ‚ÄúCreate High
    Definition Figma Designs‚Äù, ‚Äú Create GitHub repository‚Äù, "Test Website" could be broken down into "WCAG Testing", "HTML Validation", "Cross Browser Testing", etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    You may add as many additional fields to your Task items as you require. The instructions above state the minimum fields required. Other useful fields may include "Work Type", such as "Design",
    "Testing", "HTML" or "CSS", etc. Take some time to play around with Project settings and custom fields.
  </li>
  <li>
    You may adjust your plan in future when you receive the exam brief, including target dates. This project plan is a guide, not a contract. Without the exam brief, there is a limit to how detailed
    you can make your plan.
  </li>
  <li>
    Test that it is possible to view your Project as a Kanban or Roadmap/Gantt view in an incognito window or while logged out of GitHub. If you cannot access this in incognito, your teacher won't be
    able to either.
  </li>
</ul>
